# It.Ateithe

Android application for the Department of Information Technology (thesis project).
Integrating most department student services like announcements, grades, mail, etc.

This was initially developed for my thesis in 2013. The thesis itself can be found [here](https://github.com/nkyrim/IT.Ateithe/blob/master/files/scrennshots.pdf).
After the initial version developed the application was further updated to include more feature and implement, to a certain extent, the Material Design guidelines. Added here now for archival purposes.

Screen-shots for the app [here](https://github.com/nkyrim/IT.Ateithe/blob/master/files/thesis.pdf).
